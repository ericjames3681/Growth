# GROWTH

<br>


Growth is a simple app designed to search for, and curate a list of a user's favorite plants.

As a user, I'd like to browse to a site and have the ability to securely sign-up or log-in from a previously created sign-up.

As a user, I'd like the ability to curate a list of plants I currently own or wish to own in order to reference their name and image.

As a user, I'd like to be presented with a functional search bar to find plants of interest.

As a user, I'd like to be directed to a detailed "show page" for individal plants of interest with the ability to add to my personalized list.

As a user, I'd like an intuitive navigation bar that will direct me to key features.
 
End business goal: By breaking down plants of interest, third parties may be offered to advertise on site and offer deals based off user data.
 
Measurement of success: Engagement and individual contribution will translate into a more comprehensive data set to analyze and find trends.

## Next Steps
There are many opportunities for the future of GROWTH. I see the potential for a more complete data set to fetch high defintion images, care instructions, preferred light conditions. I'd like to see the option of digitally updating plants in a given "garden" with a timestamp as to reference when the last time was I watered my actual plants.  

There are many interesting API's utilizing tensor flow object detection, I would love to implement the feature of a user uploading an image or augmented reality in order to identify an unknown plant a user may encounter.
